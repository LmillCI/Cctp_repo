# cypress-timestamps ![cypress version](https://img.shields.io/badge/cypress-9.7.0-brightgreen)

> Add timestamps to Cypress tests, error screenshots, and Command Log

Read the blog post [Add Timestamps To Cypress](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-timestamps/)

## Install

```shell
$ npm i -D cypress-timestamps
# or if using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-timestamps
```

## Use

Include the plugin from your support file

```js
// cypress/support/index.js

// https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-timestamps
require('cypress-timestamps/support')()
```

Include this plugin from your project's plugin file. This is optional and is needed only if you enable the option `terminal: true` (see below)

```js
// cypress/plugin/index.js

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-timestamps
  require('cypress-timestamps/plugin')(on)
}
```

## Options

By default, this plugin adds the timestamps to the error message if a test fails, and to the parent commands in the Command Log. You can also enable printing the test start and end timestamps in the terminal by registering the plugin (see above) and enabling the option when registering the support file.

```js
// cypress/support/index.js

// https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-timestamps
require('cypress-timestamps/support')({
  terminal: true,
  error: true,
  commandLog: true,
})
```

### terminal

Prints timestamps around each test, prints a timestamp of the screenshot taken on test failure

### error

Adds the timestamp to any error thrown by the test

### commandLog

Adds timestamps before each parent command that starts a new chain of commands

### elapsed

When printing the timestamps to the command log, you can print either the absolute timestamp (by default), or the time since the test has started.

```js
// https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-timestamps
require('cypress-timestamps/support')({
  commandLog: true,
  elapsed: true,
})
```

### Stamp all commands

By default, only the parent and dual commands get a timestamp in the Command Log to avoid verbose clutter. You can enable stamping every command using the `commandLog: "all"` option.

```js
// https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-timestamps
require('cypress-timestamps/support')({
  commandLog: 'all',
  elapsed: true,
})
```
